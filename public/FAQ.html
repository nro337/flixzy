    <p class="Questions">
     <br> <strong> How can I request other movies and/or suggest new content not supported yet by the site? </strong> </br>
     Our team is actively working to provide our users with the most up to date films and shows available, but it's always possible that there are logistical issues or that it may take time in order to receive the informtation to build into our endpoint. Contact us at email.flixy.com to let us know what shows you would like to see next!
     
   </p>

   <p class="Questions">
    <br> <strong> Why can I only view 3 suggested shows at a time?</strong> </br>
    We strive to keep our interface clear and to the point, and we found that any more than three suggestions made the results page far too crowded. Slightly adjust your search query to find other shows or movies within the same genre or platform.
   </p>


   <p class="Questions">
    <br> <strong> What inspired you to build this application?</strong> </br>
      So many of our friends and family over the years have come up to us and said "I wish there was a way to search for multiple shows based on my user preferences such as genre or streaming platform of choice." We saw this as a huge opportunity to solve a problem many people seem to face on a regular basis. We wanted to do it well, do it our way. Flixy is the result.
   </p>

   <p class="Questions">
    <br> <strong> What is in store for your next update?</strong> </br>
    More precise queries, more suggestions (including a personalized algorithm to tailer each user's experience), Youtube series integration, and much much more!!
